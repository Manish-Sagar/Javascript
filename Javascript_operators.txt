There are 6 types of operators in JS.

1. Assignment 
2. Arithmetic 
3. Comparison
4. Logical
5. Conditional 
6. Type 


1. Assignment Operators: Used to assign a value to variable
    "=" is the assignment operator 
    Addition Assigment operator (+=)
    Subraction Assignment operator (-=)
    divison (/=)
    Multiplication(*=)
    modulus(%=)
    expponential(**=)

2. Arithmetic Operators: Used to perform arithmetic on numbers. 
    We have 8 types of arithmetic operators
    Addition(+), Subraction(-), Multiplication(*), Divison(/), expponential(**), modulus(%), increment(++) and decrement(--).
    Addition operator is also used to concatenate strings. 
    Adding a string and a number will result in a new concatenated string.

3. Comparison Operators: Used to compare two variables
    == compares value
    === compares value and data type
    != not equal value
    !== not equal value and data type
    >,<,>=,<=
    ? ternary operator - variable name = condition ? truest : falsest

4. Logical Operators: Used to determine logic between two values or variables
    && - and (if both statements are true returns true else false)
    || - or (if any one is true, results true)
    ! - not(if true returns false, else returns true)

5. Type Operators1: Used to know the datatype of variables or values
    typeof() - gives the data type
    instanceof() - returns true if object is an instance of an object type.

6. Bitwise Operators: Bit operators work on 32 bits numbers. Any numeric operand in the operation is converted into a 32 bit number. The result is converted back to a JavaScript number.
    & - bitwise and
    | - or
    ~ - not
    ^ - XOR
    << - left shift
    >> - right shift
    >>> unsigned right shift
