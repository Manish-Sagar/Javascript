In JavaScipt we have two types of data types. They are
1. Primitive data types
2. Non Primitive


Non Primitive dataypes: Object is the non primitve data type in JavaScript. Arrays and Functions in JS belong to object datatype.

Object - Object is the keyvalue pair in JS. Objects are mutable.

Arrays - Arrays is an object datatype. Array contains more than one value with a numerical index which starts from 0.
    As said arrays are also objects that means they also will be stored as key value pairs in memory. Here the index will be key.
    Arrays are heterogenous, that means we can declare both numbers and strings in a single array.
Functions - Javascript doesn't have functions. All functions in JS are also objects. But when we try to get the type using typeof() we will get function type only. 

Primitive dataypes: Primitive data types are the variables that refer to a single value

We have six(6) different types of Primitive data types they are.

1. Number - Can store integer, floating point valuem expponential value, NaN, infinity.
    NaN results when we try to perform an operation on a number with a non numeric value
    
2. String - Stores any group of characters enclosed by single or double quotes or by backticks

3. Boolean - Has only two datatypes true and false. Used to check condition

4. Undefined - This means that a variable is not defined

5. Null - This means that variable has no value. Null returns object as it's data type

6. Symbol - This is the datatype in new es6. Defines a property of a object which is private to the object. 
    This refers to the key in the object. Function Symbol() is used to create a new symbol.
    Every symbol is unique, two symbols with same key are also not same.
    Symbols are immutable
